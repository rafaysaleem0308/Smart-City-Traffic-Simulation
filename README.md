🏙️Smart City Traffic Simulation

Smart City Traffic Simulation is a Python/Pygame project that models traffic flow in a city grid. The simulation includes vehicles, buses, emergency vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic lights. It uses constraint-based optimization to prioritize emergency vehicles and dynamically adjusts traffic light patterns for efficient traffic flow.

🌟 Features

Dynamic City Grid: Simulates a 4x4 city grid with intersections and roads.

Vehicles & Pedestrians: Randomly spawns cars, buses, ambulances, and pedestrians.

Emergency Vehicle Prioritization: Calculates the shortest path and optimizes traffic lights for emergency routes.

Traffic Light Management: Alternating NS/EW traffic lights with real-time visualization.

Real-Time Simulation: Vehicles move smoothly along roads with progress tracking and animated emojis.

Statistics Panel: Displays total vehicles, light states, pedestrians, and emergency status.

Adjustable Simulation Speed: Control vehicle speed dynamically during runtime.
